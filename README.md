# Root-Finding--Abstract-Algebra
### -Pulaksh garg
## Abstract
n our attempt to look at one of the challenging problem of modern mathematics we ended up exploring a lot of different areas. Although a lot is known about quadratic residues and non residues it is still surprisingly difficult to generate a non residue deterministically.  Here we explore a parallel problem of root finding and analyse various algorithms for the same.  The Problem is also related to the problem ofgenerating irreducible polynomials. It is a very exciting problem for even though thetask of finding a non residue is not very difficult we would like a deterministic way to find it.
